Cephtactics Dental Diagnosis Program

The Cephtactics Dental Diagnosis Program is a platform which has been designed to provide the users insight into various dental symptoms and easy understanding of the methods which would be employed for treatment one their visit to the dentist. It gives them a quick and easy pathway as to understanding the condition they present with better so as to be able to prioritize treatment with respect to urgency.

This would be the first stage of an automated symptom checker which would be able to help the patients in finding the fastest and closest clinicians available. The further projects that this would be directed to would be sorting clinicians based on area as well as cost and accesibility.

The aims of this project are to ensure that we provide the public with enhanced diagnositic criteria for common oral health ailments.

UX
The patient would be able to access clearly from the home page the condition that they have. They should expect to know what they have and the urgency of their pathology.

User 1 - I could navigate the website easily and ended up with easily accesible data, the contact page was large and available.
User 2 - Finding out the problem with my condition was easy, contacting the team was simple, deciding on the location would be the next step.

WIREFRAMES 

The following wireframes were used and are available here.

Features

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement

More complex symptom checker, where location and time of the problem has been considered.
Location platform of dentists available with regards to time, cost, location and urgency for the condition which is present.
Emergency dentist availablilty and location.

Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS as well as Bootstrap to develop the site, the wireframe source used was Balsamiq.

Testing

I performed the first test to check the ability of the user to understand the main conditions present on mobile as well as desktop devices. 
The second tests incorporated used to check the accesibility from one page to another, ability to fill in the end form on both mobile and desktop devices.
Final testing was done where I tested the end result with respect to the multiple users and took their considerations into account regarding the user interface.

I have not run any automated tests.

The first testing outcomes:
Problems with padding in the menu on mobiles,

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
